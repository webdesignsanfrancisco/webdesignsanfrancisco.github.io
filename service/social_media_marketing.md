## Social Media Marketing

Social media in business allows you to spread your wings. Setting up a company website on social media is a necessity - a way to build a network of engaged fans, present the offer and disclose interesting facts from the life of the company - as you know, everyone likes to see the stories behind the scenes. In the long run, social media can also earn - by gaining loyal customers for a given brand.

While still Facebook is the primary tool, some types of business work better on other portals. Instagram is becoming an increasingly serious place to promote. Can it be used to build an audience and brand recognition? How can running Instagram affect your business growth?

## Running Instagram from A-Z
Instagram shows the company from the inside - what's going on at the headquarters, what news is just coming out, who the employees are. And all this is given in the form of photos, aesthetic and eye-catching or short videos added to Insta Stories.

Running Instagram requires a good plan, consistency and regularity from the very beginning. There is no single golden rule regarding the frequency of publishing content - you need to experiment and look for the perfect solution that will ensure the largest, engaged audience.

Also, do not forget that all photos and videos should contain elements of the company's visual identity, it is worth making them in a similar style (similar filters, a common element, etc.), so that they are immediately associated with the brand.

Indeed, running an Instagram must bet on a specific idea and the highest possible quality.
