<p>Well-made, clear, interesting for the recipient and providing the necessary information website is a business card of every company. Unfortunately, nowadays just having a website may not be enough to reach all potential customers.</p>

<p>As the popularity of mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, has increased, so has the user’s requirements for the user-friendliness of websites. That is why <a href="/">Freelance Web Design San Francisco</a>, a web design freelance from San Francisco, California, has been offering responsive websites adapted to various mobile devices for a long time.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-responsive-websites">What are responsive websites?</h3>

<p>Statistics show that more and more users are browsing websites on mobile devices. Responsive Web Design (RWD), which can be commissioned to Webmania, automatically adjusts to the size of the device, the browser on which it is displayed (smartphone, tablet) and its resolution. The effect is that all elements of the responsive website (e.g. logos, banners, texts, photos, font sizes, spacing) change their size and sometimes their placement on the page. Thanks to that everything is readable for the user - he does not have to enlarge the view of the screen in order to read a selected part of the text or see an interesting graphic without any problems.</p>

<p>A big advantage of responsive websites is their versatility - they display well on mobile devices and on larger screens, which means that on a desktop computer a website made with this technique looks standard. It is worth knowing that this type of websites are also recommended by Google. In practice it means that responsive websites are displayed on higher positions in search engines.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-worth-it">Why is it worth it?</h3>
<p>Responsive websites are an optimal solution and a perfect choice when creating a new, representative website for your company. Considering the significant growth of the audience using tablets and smartphones, such a solution will make customers more likely to visit such a site. Of course, it is also very important that Google favors the positioning of responsive websites - thanks to this the number of visits to the site is greater, and this can have a significant impact on conversion.</p>

<p>An additional advantage is the fact that websites created using the RWD technique are not much more expensive than standard websites, and at the same time they are a great alternative for mobile websites.</p>
