<p>Instagram shows the company from the inside - whatâ€™s going on at the headquarters, what news is just coming out, who the employees are. And all this is given in the form of photos, aesthetic and eye-catching or short videos added to Insta Stories.</p>

<p>Running Instagram requires a good plan, consistency and regularity from the very beginning. There is no single golden rule regarding the frequency of publishing content - you need to experiment and look for the perfect solution that will ensure the largest, engaged audience.</p>

<p>Also, do not forget that all photos and videos should contain elements of the companyâ€™s visual identity, it is worth making them in a similar style (similar filters, a common element, etc.), so that they are immediately associated with the brand.</p>

<p>Indeed, running an Instagram must bet on a specific idea and the highest possible quality.</p>

<p>To make your companyâ€™s Instagram work to your advantage, you need to keep in mind a few basic rules. Of course, the regularity of publication is essential. For one business it will be a few posts a day, for another 2-3 per week. It is worth looking at the behavior of your fans, see the pages of your competitors and conduct tests. Base yourself on facts and not on assumptions.</p>

<p>All content published on Instagram must be refined even to the smallest detail. Itâ€™s a great idea to create long-term schedules in which you include the most important ideas, drafts of individual campaigns and posts.</p>

<p>However, the publication itself is not everything - you also need to engage in discussions on industry topics, building the position of an expert and efficiently respond to all reactions from fans and observers. Contact is the basis for action in social media.</p>

<p>It is worth taking advantage of the multitude of tools offered by the platform. These include, of course, the Insta Story mentioned earlier, but also hashtags - the greatest power of Instagram, which allow you to enter global themes or create your own promotional slogans.</p>
